# weather-app
these files together create a weather dashboard. upon deploying application you will be able to enter a name of a city in oder to see the current weather, date, temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index. You will also see a 5 day forecast of said city which also include previously mentioned weather stats. After viewing said city the application will save the selected city incase you ever might need it for future use. I have included some screenshots of the deployed application as well.
